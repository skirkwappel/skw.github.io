title: The Effect of Institutional and Cultural Persistence of the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire on Conflict in the Yugoslav Wars
abstract: Can the persistent effects of long-gone empires on various outcomes seen in conflict levels? Using a border specification and regression discontinuity design, I estimate the effect of historical affiliation with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, using two separate border specifications, on conflict incidence during the Yugoslav Wars. My results indicate that longer historical affiliation with Austria-Hungary is associated with lower incidence of conflict, finding approximately 4-5 fewer conflict events in those municipalities with more than 200 years of imperial rule. These results are robust to 50 and 25km bandwidth around the border as well as an examination of heterogeneous effects by conflict type.
