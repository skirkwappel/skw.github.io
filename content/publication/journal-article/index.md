abstract: Scholars often cite George Sand as one of Dostoevsky’s major
  influences. The specificities of this influence are, however, rarely explored.
  Dostoevsky uses the character Edmée from George Sand’s Mauprat (1837) as a
  model for many of the female characters in his novels, including Katerina
  Ivanovna (The Brothers Karamazov 1880), Dunya Raskolnikova, and Sonya
  Marmeladova (Crime and Punishment 1866). Like their prototype, they are all
  self-sacrificing, honest, innocent, and proud. This paper examines the ways in
  which Dostoevsky varies the features of this female character type and how he
  places her in different situations in order to explore her capacity for good
  as well as her reactions, motivations, and especially her relationships. This
  reveals how the capacity of women to exercise agency establishes them as
  equals to their male counterparts, resulting in a better relationship between
  the two as well as with those who surround them.
