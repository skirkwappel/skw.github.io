abstract: Permits with high royalty costs are the medium through which mountain
  climbers obtain permission to climb Mount Everest in Nepal. This study
  examines how increased permit royalties affect risk and decision-making in
  high altitude mountaineering on Mount Everest. The economic literature has
  ascertained that changes in fixed costs have wide-ranging effects on behaviour
  and decision-making. This study applies these effects in the context of
  mountaineering, where climbers consistently make decisions in high-risk
  situations. Several estimation strategies are used across various
  specifications, including both ordinary least squares and zero-inflated
  negative binomial regressions, as well as a synthetic control. The results
  suggest that higher fixed costs may be associated with slightly lower risk
  outcomes and more risk aversion among certain climbers, but that these higher
  costs are correlated with sizable negative externalities where risk outcomes
  increase significantly on other peaks in the region.
