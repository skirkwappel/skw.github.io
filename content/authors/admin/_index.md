I am a trained economist with a comprehensive skill set and solid academic background seeking an economist position. I have extensive, in-depth knowledge and experience in conducting both qualitative and quantitative research, economic theory and empirical analysis, developing efficient workflows, and managing large data. Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Center for Innovative Data in Economics Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/research/research-centres/cider/) at the University of British Columbia Vancouver School of Economics, where I worked under Professor [Réka Juhász](http://www.rjuhasz.com/). I was also a member of the [Industrial Policy Group](https://www.industrialpolicygroup.com/) I have both a *Masters of Arts in Economics* and a *Bachelor of Arts Honours in Economics* from the University of British Columbia.
