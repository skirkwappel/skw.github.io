I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Center for Innovative Data in Economics Research](https://economics.ubc.ca/research/research-centres/cider/) at the University of British Columbia Vancouver School of Economics. I work under Professor [Réka Juhász](http://www.rjuhasz.com/). I recently completed a *Masters of Arts in Economics* at the University of British Columbia, and I also obtained my *Bachelor of Arts Honours in Economics* from the same department in 2021.
